• Documentation: Every decision is recorded and referenceable
• Precision: Written proposals eliminate ambiguity
• Time: All hours go to actual work, not meetings
• Quality: Thoughtful responses instead of reactive answers
• Async: Work happens across time zones without scheduling friction

We've found that clients who engage well in writing are also the ones who provide the detailed information needed for accurate models.`},{category:"process",question:"How long does a typical project take?",answer:`Timeline depends on package and complexity:

• Growth Package: 3-4 weeks
• Institutional Package: 4-6 weeks
• Infrastructure Package: 6-8 weeks

These assume prompt client responses. Delays in providing information extend timelines proportionally. Total from first contact to final delivery: 5-12 weeks.`},{category:"process",question:"What information do I need to provide?",answer:`Our structured intake captures everything we need:

• Project description and location
• Historical financials (if any)
• CAPEX estimates or quotes
• Revenue assumptions
• Team background
• Target DFI and timeline

Good intake = good output. We won't start until we have what we need.`},{category:"process",question:"How many revision rounds are included?",answer:`All packages include 2-3 revision rounds:

• Draft delivery with watermarked files
• 3-5 day review period for your feedback
• Revisions implemented
• Final files released on payment

Major scope changes discovered mid-project may require additional fees.`},{category:"pricing",question:"Why is JASPER more expensive than template services?",answer:`Because we deliver different value:

Template services ($500-$2,000):
• Generic spreadsheets you customise yourself
• No DFI-specific formatting
• No sector expertise
• You own the errors

JASPER ($12,000-$45,000+):
• Custom-built for your project
• DFI-ready from day one
• Sector-specific modelling
• Professional documentation
• We stand behind the work

Our models pass due diligence. Templates rarely do.`},{category:"pricing",question:"Do you accept cryptocurrency?",answer:`Yes - crypto is our preferred payment method.

We accept:
• USDC (preferred)
• USDT
• BTC
• ETH

All via Binance. This eliminates international wire fees, banking delays, and currency conversion issues.

Traditional options (Wise, Payoneer, SA bank transfer) are also available.`},{category:"pricing",question:"What are your payment terms?",answer:`Standard terms:

• 50% deposit to begin work
• 50% balance on draft delivery
• Final files released after full payment

For Infrastructure packages ($75M+ projects), we may offer milestone-based terms.`},{category:"pricing",question:"Can you work within my budget?",answer:`We don't negotiate on price - we adjust scope.

If you have $15K and need a $25K package, we can:
• Reduce the number of DFI versions
• Simplify the model structure
• Limit revision rounds

What we won't do: deliver a $25K scope for $15K. Quality has a cost.`},{category:"scope",question:"What sectors do you work in?",answer:`We specialise in sectors where DFI capital flows:

• Renewable Energy (solar, wind, biogas, storage)
• Data Centres & Digital Infrastructure
• Agri-Industrial (processing, value chains)
• Climate Finance (carbon, green bonds)
• Technology Platforms (fintech, AgTech, SaaS)
• Manufacturing & Processing

We don't work in: real estate, mining, oil & gas, shipping, aviation, hospitality, healthcare, or financial services.`},{category:"scope",question:"Why don't you model mining projects?",answer:`Two reasons:

1. Technical: Mining requires specialised expertise in geology, reserve estimation, and commodity hedging that we haven't developed.

2. Philosophy: Our focus is on beneficiation and value-addition - projects that build capacity rather than extract resources. We model what stays in the country, not what leaves.

We can refer you to mining specialists if needed.`},{category:"scope",question:"Can you help with projects outside Africa?",answer:`Absolutely. We work globally.

Our models have been formatted for:
• IFC, AfDB, ADB, EBRD, DFC
• Regional development banks
• Climate funds (GCF, SEFA, GEF)

Geography doesn't limit us. What matters is: Is it a DFI-fundable project in a sector we know?`},{category:"scope",question:"What if my project is unusual or complex?",answer:`That's often when we're most valuable.

Complexity we've handled:
• 1,300 MW integrated renewable complex
• 700 MW hyperscale data centre
• Multi-phase construction projects
• Multiple revenue streams
• Complex capital structures (debt + equity + grant)
• Multi-currency operations
• Concession and PPP structures
• 35+ sheet integrated models

Tell us about your project. We'll confirm if it's in our wheelhouse.`},{category:"trust",question:"How do I know you're legitimate?",answer:`Valid concern. Here's our answer:

We don't hide behind logos or fake testimonials. Our work speaks for itself:
• 1,308+ financial models built
• Projects up to R508.6M
• 1,300 MW renewable infrastructure designed (not just modelled)
• Real engineering background

We'll provide references on request for serious inquiries. But we don't publish case studies - our clients' projects are confidential.`},{category:"trust",question:"Who owns the deliverables?",answer:`You do. Completely.

• No usage restrictions
• No attribution required
• No ongoing fees
• No licensing

Once paid, the files are yours to use however you want. We don't retain rights or require credit.`},{category:"trust",question:"What if you can't deliver what you promised?",answer:`Two protections:

1. Fixed scope: We define exactly what's included before you pay. No ambiguity.

2. Draft review: You see watermarked files before final payment. If something's fundamentally wrong, we address it.

We've never failed to deliver on agreed scope. Our reputation depends on it.`},{category:"trust",question:"Why async-first? Is this a scam?",answer:`Fair question. Here's the reality:

Async-first is a deliberate business model choice, not evasion:
• We work with global clients across time zones
• Written communication creates better documentation
• All time goes to deliverables, not meetings
• We've found this produces better outcomes

Scammers want your money quickly with minimal accountability. We want detailed intake, fixed scope, milestone payments, and documented deliverables. That's the opposite of a scam.`}],p=i==="all"?n:n.filter(t=>t.category===i);return h.useEffect(()=>{window.scrollTo(0,0)},[]),e.jsxs("div",{className:"min-h-screen bg-brand-navy text-brand-text font-sans selection:bg-brand-emerald selection:text-brand-navy",children:[e.jsx(w,{onNavigate:d}),e.jsxs("main",{className:"pt-32 pb-20",children:[e.jsxs("section",{className:"relative px-6 lg:px-12 mb-16",children:[e.jsx("div",{className:"absolute top-0 right-0 w-[600px] h-[600px] bg-brand-emerald/5 blur-[150px] rounded-full pointer-events-none"}),e.jsx("div",{className:"container mx-auto max-w-4xl",children:e.jsxs(o.div,{initial:{opacity:0,y:20},animate:{opacity:1,y:0},transition:{duration:.8},children:[e.jsxs("div",{className:"inline-flex items-center gap-2 px-3 py-1 rounded-full bg-white/5 border border-white/10 mb-8 backdrop-blur-sm",children:[e.jsx("span",{className:"w-2 h-2 rounded-full bg-brand-emerald animate-pulse"}),e.jsx("span",{className:"text-[10px] uppercase font-bold tracking-widest text-brand-emerald",children:"FAQ"})]}),e.jsxs("h1",{className:"text-5xl md:text-7xl font-display font-bold text-white mb-8 tracking-tight leading-[1.1]",children:["Questions?",e.jsx("br",{}),e.jsx("span",{className:"text-transparent bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-r from-brand-emerald to-white",children:"Answered."})]}),e.jsx("p",{className:"text-xl text-brand-muted max-w-2xl leading-relaxed",children:"Everything you need to know about how we work, what we charge, and why we do things differently."})]})})]}),e.jsx("section",{className:"px-6 lg:px-12 mb-12",children:e.jsx("div",{className:"container mx-auto max-w-4xl",children:e.jsx("div",{className:"flex flex-wrap gap-2",children:m.map(t=>e.jsxs("button",{onClick:()=>{u(t.id),r(null)},className:`inline-flex items-center gap-2 px-4 py-2 rounded-full text-sm font-semibold transition-all ${i===t.id?"bg-brand-emerald text-white":"bg-white/5 text-gray-400 hover:bg-white/10 hover:text-white border border-white/10"}`,children:[e.jsx(t.icon,{className:"w-4 h-4"}),t.label]},t.id))})})}),e.jsx("section",{className:"px-6 lg:px-12 mb-20",children:e.jsx("div",{className:"container mx-auto max-w-4xl",children:e.jsx("div",{className:"space-y-4",children:p.map((t,a)=>e.jsxs(o.div,{initial:{opacity:0,y:10},animate:{opacity:1,y:0},transition:{delay:a*.05},className:"rounded-2xl bg-white/[0.02] border border-white/5 overflow-hidden",children:[e.jsxs("button",{onClick:()=>r(s===a?null:a),className:"w-full px-6 py-5 flex items-center justify-between text-left group",children:[e.jsx("span",{className:"text-lg font-semibold text-white group-hover:text-brand-emerald transition-colors pr-4",children:t.question}),e.jsx(k,{className:`w-5 h-5 text-brand-emerald shrink-0 transition-transform duration-300 ${s===a?"rotate-180":""}`})]}),e.jsx(g,{children:s===a&&e.jsx(o.div,{initial:{height:0,opacity:0},animate:{height:"auto",opacity:1},exit:{height:0,opacity:0},transition:{duration:.3},className:"overflow-hidden",children:e.jsx("div",{className:"px-6 pb-6",children:e.jsx("div",{className:"pt-2 border-t border-white/5",children:e.jsx("pre",{className:"text-gray-400 text-sm leading-relaxed whitespace-pre-wrap font-sans mt-4",children:t.answer})})})})})]},a))})})}),e.jsx("section",{className:"px-6 lg:px-12 mb-20",children:e.jsx("div",{className:"container mx-auto max-w-2xl",children:e.jsxs("div",{className:"p-8 rounded-3xl bg-[#0F172A] border border-brand-emerald/20 text-center",children:[e.jsx(N,{className:"w-10 h-10 text-brand-emerald mx-auto mb-4"}),e.jsx("h3",{className:"text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4",children:"Still have questions?"}),e.jsx("p",{className:"text-brand-muted mb-6",children:"We'd rather answer your questions than have you guess.
