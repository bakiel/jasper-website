Every assumption is documented with source and date. This is standard for pre-feasibility and feasibility stage work."},{q:"Can I see a sample model?",a:"We can share anonymised structural samples showing sheet architecture. Full models contain client confidential information."},{q:"Why is JASPER more expensive than freelancers?",a:"Freelancers typically deliver 10-15 sheet general models. JASPER delivers 25-50+ sheet DFI-specific architectures with institutional formatting, sensitivity dashboards, and IC-ready documentation. Our models have secured funding from IFC, DBSA, IDC, and other major DFIs."},{q:"How does JASPER compare to Big 4 consulting?",a:"Big 4 firms charge $327-$1,193 per hour for financial modelling. A comparable model would cost $80,000-$200,000+ and take 3-6 months. JASPER delivers equivalent rigour at 60-85% lower cost in 3-12 weeks fixed-price."},{q:"Isn't this expensive for a financial model?",a:"Perspective matters: Our fees represent 0.03%-0.24% of the funding you're seeking. A $25,000 investment to unlock $50M in infrastructure finance is a 2,000x potential return. The question isn't whether you can afford quality modelling—it's whether you can afford not to have it."},{q:"Can't I just use a template?",a:"DFI investment committees review thousands of applications. Template-based submissions signal lack of serious preparation. Our models are built specifically for each DFI's evaluation criteria and demonstrate the rigorous analysis that distinguishes fundable projects from rejected ones."}],S=[{number:"01",title:"Inquiry",description:"Email with project overview."},{number:"02",title:"Intake",description:"Complete detailed intake form."},{number:"03",title:"Proposal",description:"Fixed-price proposal in 24-48h."},{number:"04",title:"Production",description:"50% deposit starts work."},{number:"05",title:"Delivery",description:"Review, final payment, clean files."}],F={good:["Projects seeking $5M+ in development finance","Applications to IFC, AfDB, ADB, EBRD, IDC, DBSA","Deals requiring investment committee approval","Infrastructure, agriculture, technology, manufacturing","Entrepreneurs who value quality over speed","Teams prepared to provide detailed project information"],bad:["Bank loans under $1M","Visa or immigration business plans","Franchise disclosure documents",'"I need it tomorrow" rush jobs',"Template-acceptable applications","Projects without basic feasibility data"]};export{I as A,F,v as M,S as P,D as S,C as a,f as b,h as c,b as d,y as e};
