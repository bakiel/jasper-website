DFIs increasingly fund tech, but their metrics differ from VC.
They want development impact alongside commercial returns.

We model both:
• Commercial metrics (ARR, unit economics)

This dual-lens approach is rare. Most tech modellers
don't understand DFI requirements.

## Section 9: Sectors We Don't Model

**H2:** Where We're Not The Right Fit

```
We believe in honest positioning. These sectors require
expertise we haven't developed:

• Real estate development (residential/commercial)
• Mining and extractive industries
• Oil and gas
• Shipping and maritime
• Aviation
• Hospitality (hotels, resorts)
• Healthcare facilities
• Financial services (banks, insurers)

If your project is in these sectors, we'll refer you to
specialists who know them better than we do.
```

**Why We Say No:**
```
MINING & EXTRACTIVES
────────────────────
Beyond technical expertise gaps, our focus is on
beneficiation and value-addition—not extraction.
We model what builds capacity, not what depletes resources.

REAL ESTATE
───────────
Different valuation methods, different risk profiles,
different financing structures. Specialists exist for this.

OIL & GAS
─────────
Transitional sector with complex technical requirements.
We focus on the energy future, not the energy past.
```
