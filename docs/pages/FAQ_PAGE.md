## Section 2: About Our Approach

**H2:** How We Work

```
Q: Why don't you offer phone calls or video meetings?

A: Because they don't improve output—and often reduce it.

Here's what calls typically produce:
• Miscommunication (no written record)
• Scope creep ("while we're talking...")
• Scheduling delays across time zones
• Reactive answers instead of considered ones

Here's what async communication produces:
• Everything documented and referenceable
• Thoughtful responses, not off-the-cuff
• No scheduling friction
• Clear accountability

We've found that clients who prefer calls often want reassurance,
not information. Our detailed intake, proposals, and updates
provide that reassurance—in writing.

The work speaks louder than conversation.
```

---

```
Q: How do I know you're legitimate without meeting you?

A: Fair question. Here's how:

VERIFIABLE
──────────
• Registered South African company (Gahn Eden Pty Ltd, 2015/272887/07)
• Professional email on our domain
• Fixed pricing (scammers prefer vague quotes)
• 50% upfront / 50% on delivery (we have skin in the game too)
• Detailed proposals before any payment
• Watermarked drafts before final payment

DEMONSTRABLE
────────────
• Sample model structures available on request
• Methodology explained in detail on this site
• Clear deliverables, not vague promises

We don't ask you to trust blindly. We ask you to evaluate
our process, our documentation, and our terms. If those
don't give you confidence, we're not the right fit.
```

---

```
Q: Why async-only? What if I have urgent questions?

A: Async doesn't mean slow. It means structured.

OUR RESPONSE TIMES
──────────────────
• Initial inquiry: 48 hours
• During production: 24-48 hours
• Urgent clarifications: Same day when possible

WHAT "URGENT" ACTUALLY MEANS
────────────────────────────
Most "urgent" questions aren't. They feel urgent because
of anxiety, not because the project depends on immediate response.

True urgency (blocking project progress) gets prioritised.
We're not rigid—we're efficient.

If you need hand-holding and constant reassurance,
we're genuinely not the right fit. Our clients are
busy professionals who value results over rapport.
```

---

```
Q: Why is there no address or phone number on the website?

A: Because neither improves our service to you.

WHAT A PHYSICAL ADDRESS PROVIDES
────────────────────────────────
• Nothing. We don't have walk-in clients.
• Our work is delivered digitally.
• We serve clients globally.

WHAT A PHONE NUMBER PROVIDES
────────────────────────────
• Interruptions that reduce work quality
• No documentation of conversations
• Time zone complications

WHAT MATTERS
────────────
• We're a registered company (verifiable)
• We use professional email on our domain
• We provide detailed written proposals
• We deliver tangible files you can evaluate
• Our terms protect both parties

The "ghost" approach isn't about hiding. It's about focus.
Every hour not spent on calls is an hour spent on your model.
```

---

## Section 3: About Payment

**H2:** Payment Questions

```
Q: Why do you prefer cryptocurrency?

A: Several practical reasons:

SPEED
─────
Crypto settles in minutes. International bank transfers
take 3-5 business days and sometimes fail.

NO CHARGEBACKS
──────────────
PayPal and credit cards allow chargebacks—even after
work is delivered. This protects buyers but exposes
service providers to fraud. We've chosen not to accept
that risk.

LOWER FEES
──────────
International wire transfers cost $25-50+ in fees.
Crypto costs a few dollars.

GLOBAL ACCESS
─────────────
Some banking systems make international payments
difficult. Crypto works everywhere.

IF YOU DON'T USE CRYPTO
───────────────────────
We also accept Wise and Payoneer. These are established
international transfer platforms with reasonable fees
and good reliability.

Bank transfers are possible by arrangement, but expect
delays and higher fees.
```

---

```
Q: Why 50% upfront? That's a lot of money.

A: It's standard for professional services. Here's why:

WHAT 50% UPFRONT DOES
─────────────────────
• Confirms you're serious (filters tyre-kickers)
• Secures your slot in our schedule
• Covers our initial work investment
• Aligns incentives (we both have skin in the game)

WHAT IT DOESN'T DO
──────────────────
• Give us your money and disappear (we want repeat clients)
• Leave you without recourse (you get drafts before final payment)

THE OTHER 50%
─────────────
Due only after you've reviewed draft deliverables.
You see the work before paying the balance.
Final files released upon final payment.

This structure protects both parties:
• You: See drafts before final payment
• Us: Compensated for work before releasing files

If 50% upfront is a dealbreaker, we're not aligned.
```

---

```
Q: Why don't you offer payment plans?

A: Because our pricing already reflects value, not financing.

REALITY CHECK
─────────────
If a project needs $15M in funding, a $12K-$45K
investment in professional modelling is <0.3% of the deal.

If that's unaffordable, the project may not be ready
for DFI funding yet.

WHAT WE'VE SEEN
───────────────
Payment plan requests often come from:
• Projects not yet fundable
• Clients who won't prioritise the engagement
• Higher risk of non-payment

We'd rather work with fewer clients who are ready
than many who aren't.
```

---

```
Q: What if I'm not satisfied with the work?

A: We have a revision process for that.

INCLUDED REVISIONS
──────────────────
Growth:         2 rounds
Institutional:  2 rounds
Infrastructure: 3 rounds

Revision rounds address:
• Factual corrections
• Reasonable adjustments
• Clarification requests

WHAT REVISIONS DON'T COVER
──────────────────────────
• "I changed my business model"
• "I want different assumptions now"
• "Add features not in the original scope"

REFUNDS
───────
We don't refund for completed work that meets specifications.
Our detailed proposal process ensures alignment before we start.

If there's a fundamental mismatch, it's caught at proposal stage—
not after delivery.
```

---

## Section 4: About Our Work

**H2:** The Work Itself

```
Q: Can I see a sample model before committing?

A: Partially, yes.

WHAT WE CAN SHARE
─────────────────
• Anonymised structural samples (sheet architecture)
• Screenshots of formatting and layout
• Methodology documentation
• Sample executive summary format

WHAT WE CAN'T SHARE
───────────────────
• Complete models (contain client confidential data)
• Sector-specific builds (proprietary to clients)

Our methodology page explains exactly how we build.
The proposal will detail exactly what you'll receive.
```

---

```
Q: How do I know the model will work for my DFI?

A: Because we build for DFI requirements from the start.

DFI-SPECIFIC ELEMENTS
─────────────────────
• Metrics they look for (DSCR, IRR, payback)
• Formatting they expect
• Development impact indicators
• Sensitivity analysis requirements

We ask which DFI(s) you're targeting during intake.
The model is structured for their requirements.

Institutional and Infrastructure packages include
DFI-specific formatting as standard.

Growth package focuses on fundamentals—you can add
DFI formatting later if needed.
```

---

```
Q: What if my project is unusual or complex?

A: That's often when we're most valuable.

COMPLEXITY WE'VE HANDLED
────────────────────────
• 1,300 MW integrated renewable complex
• 700 MW hyperscale data centre
• Multi-phase construction projects
• Multiple revenue streams
• Complex capital structures (debt + equity + grant)
• Multi-currency operations
• Concession and PPP structures
• 35+ sheet integrated models

If your project is genuinely unusual, tell us in your inquiry.
We'll assess whether we can handle it—and tell you honestly
if we can't.

WHAT WE DON'T DO
────────────────
• Real estate development
• Mining and extractives
• Oil and gas
• Shipping and maritime
• Aviation
• Hospitality
• Healthcare facilities
• Financial services (banks, insurers)

For these sectors, we'll refer you to specialists.
```

---

```
Q: Do you guarantee funding approval?

A: No. And anyone who does is lying.

WHAT WE CONTROL
───────────────
• Model quality and accuracy
• Professional presentation
• DFI-appropriate formatting
• Clear documentation

WHAT WE DON'T CONTROL
─────────────────────
• DFI decision-making
• Your project's fundamentals
• Market conditions
• Regulatory environment
• Your team's credibility

A perfect model doesn't save a weak project.
A weak model can kill a strong project.

We ensure the model isn't your weakness.
The rest is up to you and the DFI.
```

---

## Section 5: About Trust

**H2:** Building Confidence

```
Q: You're in South Africa. Can you handle international projects?

A: Yes. Here's why location doesn't limit us:

WHAT WE'VE MODELLED
───────────────────
• Projects across Africa
• DFI applications for IFC, AfDB, ADB, IDC, Land Bank
• Multi-country operations
• Cross-border funding structures

WHAT LOCATION AFFECTS
─────────────────────
• Nothing about model quality
• Nothing about DFI understanding
• Nothing about delivery

WHAT LOCATION PROVIDES
──────────────────────
• Deep emerging market experience
• Understanding of African DFI landscape
• Competitive pricing (not London/NYC rates)
• Real development finance context (not theoretical)

Many "international" consultants have never worked in
emerging markets. We've built our expertise here.
```

---

```
Q: Why should I trust a company I've never heard of?

A: You shouldn't—yet. Here's how to verify:

BEFORE PAYING ANYTHING
──────────────────────
1. Review our methodology (this site)
2. Request sample structure
3. Complete intake (costs you nothing)
4. Review detailed proposal
5. Verify company registration

You'll know exactly what you're getting before any money changes hands.

AFTER 50% DEPOSIT
─────────────────
1. Receive regular milestone updates
2. Review assumptions document
3. Provide feedback throughout
4. Receive watermarked draft for review
5. Request adjustments

You see substantial work before paying the balance.

THE REAL QUESTION
─────────────────
Do our process, terms, and approach give you confidence?
If yes, proceed. If no, don't.

We don't need to convince everyone. We need to serve
the clients who recognise quality.
```

---

```
Q: What happens if you disappear with my deposit?

A: You can verify we're real. Here's how:

COMPANY REGISTRATION
────────────────────
Gahn Eden (Pty) Ltd
Registration: 2015/272887/07
Registered in South Africa since 2015
Verifiable via CIPC (Companies and Intellectual Property Commission)

OUR INCENTIVES
──────────────
• We want repeat clients and referrals
• Our reputation is our business
• 50% on delivery means we need to deliver
• Registered company = legal accountability

PRACTICAL REALITY
─────────────────
If we took deposits and disappeared:
• We'd be committing fraud (criminal offence)
• We'd destroy our business
• We'd get maybe $6K-$22K (not worth it)
• You could pursue legal action

The structure protects both parties. We're not anonymous.
```

---

## Section 6: Practical Questions

**H2:** Getting Started

```
Q: How long does the whole process take?

A: Typically 5-12 weeks, depending on package and responsiveness.

BREAKDOWN
─────────
Inquiry to Intake:      1-3 days
Intake Completion:      3-7 days (client dependent)
Proposal:               24-48 hours
Production:             3-8 weeks (by package)
Review & Revision:      1-2 weeks

YOUR RESPONSIVENESS MATTERS
───────────────────────────
Slow responses = extended timeline.
We can't work faster than you provide information.
```

---

```
Q: What if I need to pause the project?

A: You can pause once, for up to 30 days.

PAUSE TERMS
───────────
• Maximum one pause per project
• Maximum 30 days
• Resume where we left off
• No additional fees

AFTER 30 DAYS
─────────────
Project considered cancelled.
Work completed to date is yours.
No refund of deposit.

If you need longer pause, discuss upfront.
We may be able to accommodate with adjusted terms.
```

---

```
Q: Can I make changes after the project starts?

A: Minor clarifications, yes. Scope changes, with adjustment.

INCLUDED
────────
• Correcting factual errors
• Clarifying assumptions
• Minor adjustments within scope

NOT INCLUDED
────────────
• New revenue streams
• Different business model
• Additional scenarios beyond package
• Changed funding structure

Scope changes require:
• Written agreement
• Revised pricing
• Adjusted timeline
• Possible additional deposit
```

---

```
Q: What if my project isn't ready for DFI funding?

A: We'll tell you honestly at inquiry stage.

SIGNS YOU'RE NOT READY
──────────────────────
• No clear business model yet
• Seeking under $5M
• No technical feasibility established
• No team in place
• Funding timeline under 4 weeks

If these apply, we'll decline—but we won't waste your time
pretending otherwise.

Some projects need more development before modelling.
That's okay. Come back when you're ready.
```

---

## Section 7: The Unconventional Stuff

**H2:** Why We're Different

```
Q: Why don't you have testimonials or case studies?

A: Client confidentiality.

THE REALITY
───────────
Our clients are seeking funding. Their projects are
confidential. Many prefer we don't mention them at all.

WHAT WE CAN SAY
───────────────
• Sectors we've worked in
• Scale of projects modelled
• Types of DFIs targeted
• General outcomes (anonymised)

WHAT WE CAN'T SAY
─────────────────
• Client names without permission
• Specific project details
• Funding outcomes

This may make marketing harder. We've accepted that trade-off
in exchange for client trust.

If a client offers to be a reference, we'll connect you.
But we don't ask clients to market for us.
```

---

```
Q: Why do you turn away clients?

A: Because focus produces quality.

WE DECLINE
──────────
• Projects under $5M (not our specialty)
• Sectors we don't know deeply
• Clients who need hand-holding
• Rush jobs without proper intake
• Price negotiators

WHY THIS HELPS YOU
──────────────────
When we say yes, we're fully committed.
We're not juggling 20 projects for volume.
We're doing 2-3 properly.

If we decline your project, it's not personal.
It means someone else will serve you better.
```

---

```
Q: This all seems very... controlled. Are you hard to work with?

A: Structured, not difficult.

WHAT WE'RE STRICT ABOUT
───────────────────────
• Scope definition
• Payment terms
• Communication channels
• Timeline expectations

WHAT WE'RE FLEXIBLE ABOUT
─────────────────────────
• Understanding your project
• Adapting to genuine complexity
• Accommodating real deadlines
• Working through problems

Our process exists to protect quality—for you and for us.
Clients who've worked with us appreciate the clarity.

If you need a vendor who'll say yes to everything,
we're not that. If you want a partner who'll deliver
what's promised, we are.
```

---

## Section 8: Final Questions

**H2:** Before You Decide

```
Q: What's the single best reason to work with you?

A: You'll get a complete investment package that survives
DFI scrutiny—not a template with your numbers plugged in.

We've built the architecture. We've refined the methodology.
We know what DFIs look for because we've studied it obsessively.

The output isn't "a financial model."
It's a funding instrument.
```

---

```
Q: What's the single best reason NOT to work with you?

A: If you need a lot of personal interaction, reassurance,
and hand-holding, we'll frustrate you.

Our process is efficient, not warm.
Our communication is clear, not chatty.
Our focus is on output, not relationship.

Some clients want a consultant who feels like a partner.
We're the consultant who delivers the work.

Both are valid. Know which you need.
```
