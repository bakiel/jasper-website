## Section 1: Hero

**H1 Headline:**
```
How We Work
```

**Subheadline:**
```
Async-first. Documentation-driven. Quality-focused.
No discovery calls. No scope creep. Clear communication at every step.
```

---

## Section 2: Why Async

**H2:** Why We Don't Do Calls

```
Traditional consulting:
─────────────────────
• Discovery call (1 hour)
• Follow-up call (30 min)
• Progress calls (weekly)
• Review meetings (multiple)
• Final presentation (1 hour)

= 10+ hours of meetings that don't produce deliverables

JASPER approach:
────────────────
• Structured intake form (captures everything)
• Written proposals (clear, referenceable)
• Milestone updates (documented progress)
• Async feedback (thoughtful, not reactive)

= All time spent on actual work

Why this is better:
───────────────────
1. You get our deep work, not our small talk
2. Everything is documented and referenceable
3. No scheduling across time zones
4. Faster turnaround (no meeting delays)
5. Clear accountability (it's all in writing)
```

## Section 3: The 5-Step Process

**[INFOGRAPHIC REQUIRED: Process Flow]**

### Step 1: Inquiry

```
WHAT HAPPENS
────────────
You email models@jasperfinance.org with:
• Brief project description
• Funding amount sought
• Target DFI (if known)
• Timeline expectations

WE RESPOND (within 48 hours)
────────────────────────────
• Confirmation of fit (or honest decline)
• Link to intake form
• Preliminary questions if needed

NO COMMITMENT YET
─────────────────
This is just initial contact.
No fees, no obligations.
```

### Step 2: Intake

```
WHAT HAPPENS
────────────
You complete our structured intake form:
• Detailed project information
• Business model description
• Historical financials (if available)
• CAPEX and revenue assumptions
• Team background
• Supporting documents upload

WHY THIS MATTERS
────────────────
Good intake = good output.
The more detail you provide, the better
we understand your project.

Incomplete intake = delayed start.
We won't begin until we have what we need.

TIME REQUIRED
─────────────
Typically 2-4 hours to complete properly.
Take your time. Quality input matters.
```

### Step 3: Proposal

```
WHAT HAPPENS
────────────
Within 24-48 hours of complete intake:
• Fixed-price proposal
• Recommended package
• Specific deliverables listed
• Timeline with milestones
• Payment terms

WHAT YOU DECIDE
───────────────
• Accept as-is
• Request adjustments
• Decline (no obligation)

NO NEGOTIATION ON SCOPE
───────────────────────
Price is fixed for defined scope.
Want more? Pay more.
Want less? We'll adjust deliverables.

We don't discount. We don't haggle.
The price reflects the work.
```

### Step 4: Production

```
WHAT HAPPENS
────────────
Upon 50% deposit:
• Work begins immediately
• You receive start confirmation
• Timeline milestones confirmed

DURING PRODUCTION
─────────────────
• Milestone updates at key points:
  - Assumptions locked (Week 1-2)
  - Model structure complete (Week 2-3)
  - Draft ready for review (Week 3-4+)
• Questions via email as needed
• No calls unless critical

YOUR ROLE
─────────
• Respond to clarification requests
• Provide additional data if needed
• Review assumptions document
• Be available for questions

TYPICAL COMMUNICATION
─────────────────────
• 2-3 email exchanges per week
• Structured updates, not status calls
• Clear action items when needed
```

### Step 5: Delivery

```
WHAT HAPPENS
────────────
Draft delivery:
• Watermarked files for review
• 3-5 day review period
• Feedback via email or structured form

Revision process:
• 2-3 rounds depending on package
• Clear change requests only
• Additional rounds at $150/hour

Final delivery (upon 50% final payment):
• Clean, unwatermarked files
• All documentation
• Model unlocked (if requested)
• Support period begins

WHAT YOU RECEIVE
────────────────
• Excel model (.xlsx)
• Business plan (.pdf) - if included
• Investment memorandum (.pdf)
• Documentation (.pdf)
• Source files (if applicable)
```

## Section 6: What Can Go Wrong

**H2:** Potential Issues & How We Handle Them

```
ISSUE: Incomplete intake information
RESULT: Timeline delayed until information received
PREVENTION: Complete intake thoroughly before submission

ISSUE: Significant scope change mid-project
RESULT: Proposal revised, additional fees may apply
PREVENTION: Define scope clearly upfront, avoid changes

ISSUE: Slow client response to questions
RESULT: Timeline extends proportionally
PREVENTION: Be responsive during production phase

ISSUE: Fundamental disagreement on approach
RESULT: Discussion via email, possible scope adjustment
PREVENTION: Review assumptions document carefully early

ISSUE: "I expected something different"
RESULT: Revision rounds address within scope
PREVENTION: Review proposal deliverables carefully,
            ask questions before starting

WE DO NOT:
──────────
• Rush delivery (quality requires time)
