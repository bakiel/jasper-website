## Section 2: Before You Contact Us

**Authority Statement:**
```
We're selective about the projects we take on.
Not because we're difficult—because focus produces quality.

Before reaching out, confirm your project meets these criteria:
```

**Qualification Checklist:**
```
YOUR PROJECT SHOULD BE:
───────────────────────
☑ Seeking $5M+ in development finance
☑ Targeting a DFI (IFC, AfDB, ADB, EBRD, IDC, etc.)
☑ In a sector we serve (Renewable Energy, Data Centres, Agri-Industrial, Climate Finance, Technology, Manufacturing)
☑ Ready for financial modelling (basic feasibility known)
☑ Timeline of 4+ weeks (no rush jobs)

YOUR TEAM SHOULD BE:
────────────────────
☑ Prepared to provide detailed project information
☑ Responsive to questions (48-72 hour turnaround)
☑ Able to pay 50% deposit upfront
☑ Comfortable with async communication

IF THIS ISN'T YOU:
──────────────────
No problem. For bank loans under $1M, visa applications,
or quick-turnaround templates, local business plan
services are a better fit.
