# JASPER Financial Architecture
## Complete Business Strategy Document

**Version:** 3.0
**Date:** December 2025 (Research-Updated)
**Status:** Active
**Domain:** jasperfinance.org

## Executive Summary

JASPER Financial Architecture delivers investment-grade financial models for renewable energy, infrastructure, data centres, and agri-industrial projects seeking DFI funding globally. We provide integrated financial models (up to 35 sheets), professional business plans, and multi-institution formatting—not generic templates or basic spreadsheets.

**Core Positioning:** Financial models built by people who've designed the systems.

**The Edge:** Most financial modellers understand Excel. We understand how energy systems, infrastructure, and data centres actually operate. That's why our models pass both technical and financial due diligence.

**Proven Capability:**
- 1,300 MW renewable complex designed & modelled (solar, wind, biogas, battery storage, smart grid)
- 700 MW data centre with power/cooling economics
- 35-sheet maximum model complexity
- 4 DFI-specific versions from single projects
- Smart city energy infrastructure with hydrogen, waste-to-energy, EV networks

**Market Position:** Between free advisory programs (GET.invest covers €250K-€70M) and Big 4 consulting ($50K-$500K+). We fill the gap with $12K-$45K packages for projects that need quality but not a brand name.

**Target Client:** Renewable energy developers, infrastructure SPVs, data centre developers, and agri-industrial projects seeking $5M+ from IFC, AfDB, ADB, EBRD, IDC, DBSA, GCF, and climate funds worldwide. NOT for bank loans under $1M, visa applications, or template-acceptable needs.

**Geographic Scope:** Global — wherever DFIs deploy capital. MENA, SEA, LatAm, Africa, and emerging markets.

## 1. Business Model Decisions

### 1.1 Why International Positioning (Not SA-Only)

| Factor | SA Market Reality | International Opportunity |
|--------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| Pricing | Clients negotiate everything | USD pricing accepted as standard |
| Payment | "Pay after funding" culture | Upfront deposits expected |
| Appreciation | Quality often not recognized | Premium quality commands premium price |
| Volume | High effort, low return | 4-6 clients/month at proper rates |
| Protection | Difficult to enforce | Crypto payments = no chargebacks |

**Decision:** Position internationally from day one. SA clients can engage but must follow international terms.

### 1.2 Target Sectors (Research-Validated)

1. **Renewable Energy** - Solar, wind, biogas, battery storage, smart grid, IPP projects
2. **Data Centres & Digital Infrastructure** - Hyperscale facilities, power/cooling economics
3. **Agri-Industrial** - Food processing, biogas feedstock, value chains, storage
4. **Climate & Green Finance** - Carbon credits, green bonds, climate adaptation projects

These sectors were selected based on market research showing:
- $193B addressable energy transition market (Africa 2023-2031)
- 156+ renewable energy developers in Africa alone seeking bankable models
- Data centre demand growing across emerging markets (power-intensive = model-intensive)
- Climate funds actively deploying — GCF, SEFA, GEF require rigorous financial models
- These clients can pay $12K-$45K (unlike SA SME market at R3K-R20K)

**Geographic Focus:** Global — wherever DFIs deploy capital. Primary: Africa, MENA, SEA, LatAm.

### 1.3 Target DFIs

**Tier 1 (Primary Focus):**
- IFC (International Finance Corporation)
- AfDB (African Development Bank)
- ADB (Asian Development Bank)
- EBRD (European Bank for Reconstruction)
- IDB (Inter-American Development Bank)

**Tier 2 (Regional):**
- IDC (South Africa)
- DBSA (Development Bank of Southern Africa)
- Land Bank (South Africa)
- OPIC/DFC (US Development)
- CDC Group (UK Development)

## 2. Service Architecture

### 2.1 Package Structure

| Package | Price (USD) | Best For | Timeline |
|---------|-------------|----------|----------|
| **Growth** | $12,000 | SMEs, Series A/B, first DFI application | 3-4 weeks |
| **Institutional** | $25,000 | Mid-market, multiple funding sources | 4-6 weeks |
| **Infrastructure** | $45,000 | Large-scale, government PPPs, $50M+ | 6-8 weeks |

### 2.2 Why These Price Points

**$12,000 Growth Package:**
- Entry point for serious clients
- Filters out "just looking" inquiries
- Still accessible for legitimate SMEs with fundable projects
- Covers 60-80 hours of specialized work

**$25,000 Institutional Package:**
- Sweet spot for mid-market deals
- Justifiable against $5-20M funding applications
- Represents <0.5% of typical funding sought
- Includes scenario modelling DFIs require

**$45,000 Infrastructure Package:**
- Premium tier for complex projects
- $50M+ projects easily justify this investment
- Comprehensive deliverable package
- Positions against Big 4 consulting ($100K+)

### 2.3 What's Included vs. Excluded

**Included (All Packages):**
- Complete financial model (JASPER architecture)
- Executive summary
- Investment memo
- Model documentation
- 2 revision rounds
- 30-day email support

**Excluded (Prevents Scope Creep):**

## 3. Async-Only Process

### 3.1 Why No Calls

| Traditional Approach | Problems | Async Approach |
|---------------------|----------|----------------|
| Discovery calls | Time sink, no pay | Structured intake form |
| Progress calls | Interrupts deep work | Written updates |
| Review meetings | Scope creep starts | Documented feedback |
| Follow-up calls | Never-ending | Clear deliverables |

**Reality:** Calls benefit the client more than the provider. They consume time without payment and open the door to "quick questions" that expand scope.

### 3.2 The 5-Step Async Process

```
Step 1: INQUIRY
Client emails models@jasperfinance.org
↓
Step 2: INTAKE
Client completes detailed intake form
Provides all business documentation
↓
Step 3: PROPOSAL
We send fixed-price proposal (24-48 hours)
Clear scope, timeline, deliverables
↓
Step 4: PRODUCTION
50% deposit → work begins
Written progress updates
Structured feedback via email
↓
Step 5: DELIVERY
Draft delivery (watermarked)
Client review & feedback
Final payment → clean files released
```

### 3.3 Communication Guidelines

**We Provide:**
- Written proposals within 48 hours
- Progress updates at milestones
- Draft files for review
- Prompt email responses (24-48 hours)

**We Don't Provide:**
- Phone calls
- Video meetings
- "Quick chats"
- Screen sharing sessions
- Slack/WhatsApp access

**Exception:** Major scope clarifications may warrant a single call, scheduled and time-boxed (30 min max).

---

## 4. Payment Protection Strategy

### 4.1 Payment Terms

```
50% UPFRONT → Work begins
50% ON DELIVERY → Final files released
```

No exceptions. No payment plans. No "pay when funded."

### 4.2 Payment Methods (Priority Order)

| Method | Priority | Why |
|--------|----------|-----|
| **Crypto (USDC/USDT)** | Preferred | Irreversible, no chargebacks, fast |
| **Crypto (BTC/ETH)** | Accepted | Same benefits, more volatility |
| **Wise** | Alternative | Lower fees than wire, personal name |
| **Payoneer** | Alternative | Good for some regions, personal name |
| **Bank Transfer (FNB)** | By arrangement | Gahn Eden account, for specific cases |

**Not Accepted:** PayPal (chargebacks), checks, payment plans, escrow services

### 4.3 Why Crypto is Preferred

1. **No chargebacks** - Once confirmed, payment is final
2. **No disputes** - No PayPal "item not as described" claims
3. **Fast settlement** - Funds available immediately
4. **Global access** - Works from any country
5. **Lower fees** - Especially for international payments
6. **Privacy** - Transaction between wallets only

### 4.4 File Protection Protocol

**Before Final Payment:**
- All drafts watermarked: "DRAFT - JASPER FINANCIAL"
- Watermark across all pages diagonally
- Low-resolution where applicable
- Key formulas may show sample values

**After Final Payment:**
- Clean, unwatermarked files
- Full resolution
- Complete formulas
- All supporting documentation

### 4.5 Red Flags - Do Not Accept Client

- Negotiates price more than once
- Asks for payment plan
- "I'll pay when funding comes through"
- Wants extensive calls before paying deposit
- "Can you start while I arrange payment?"
- Sends unsigned NDA expecting you to sign first
- Compares you to Fiverr/Upwork providers
- "My cousin is a developer, why so expensive?"
- Asks for spec work or samples
- Pressures for immediate start

## 5. Entity & Brand Structure

### 5.1 Brand Hierarchy

```
JASPER™ Financial Architecture
(The Brand - All Client-Facing)
        ↓
    Gahn Eden
(Business Entity - FNB Account)
        ↓
  Personal Accounts
(Wise/Payoneer - Individual Name)
```

### 5.2 What Goes Where

| Use Case | Entity/Brand |
|----------|--------------|
| Website | JASPER |
| Email | models@jasperfinance.org |
| Proposals | JASPER Financial Architecture |
| Contracts | JASPER / Gahn Eden |
| Invoices | JASPER |
| Crypto payments | Wallet address (no name) |
| Wise/Payoneer | Personal name |
| Bank transfer | Gahn Eden (FNB) |

### 5.3 Ghost Mode Strategy

**Visible:**
- JASPER brand
- jasperfinance.org domain
- models@ email
- Methodology content
- Portfolio examples (anonymized)

**Not Visible:**
- Personal name
- Personal photo
- Personal social media
- Physical address
- Phone number

**Rationale:** Focus on the system, not the individual. Clients buy methodology, not personality. Protects against personal attacks on social media.

## 14. The Knowledge Moat

### Why We're Different

Most financial modellers learn projects from client documents. We've designed these systems ourselves:

**Energy Systems We've Designed:**
- Solar + wind + biogas + pyrolysis integration (1,300 MW)
- Battery storage sizing and smart grid architecture (600 MW storage)
- Generation-to-distribution economics
- PPA structures and tariff escalation modelling

**Infrastructure We've Architected:**
- Waste-to-energy plants
- Hydrogen fuel cells for transport fleets
- EV charging network design
- Heat reuse systems (data centre → greenhouse integration)

**Data Centre Economics:**
- Power load profiles and redundancy costing
- Liquid cooling vs air cooling trade-offs
- Uptime guarantees and SLA financial impact
- Net-zero facility design

**Agricultural & Food Systems:**
- Biogas feedstock cultivation (Bana grass economics)
- Food-energy-water nexus integration
- Hydroponic container farming systems
- School nutrition programme integration
- Cold chain and post-harvest processing
- Commodity pricing and seasonality modelling
- Pilot-to-scale funding structures

**Manufacturing & Processing:**
- Food processing facility economics
- Production capacity and yield modelling
- Working capital cycles for FMCG
- Distribution network economics
- Quality certification cost integration (HACCP, ISO 22000)

### What This Means

When a client brings us a renewable energy project, we don't ask "what are your assumptions?" — we ask "have you considered the heat reuse revenue stream?"

**This isn't a separate service. It's why our models pass when others fail.**

Our models survive both:
1. **Technical due diligence** — engineers reviewing system assumptions
2. **Financial due diligence** — bankers reviewing the numbers

Most models only pass one. Ours pass both.
