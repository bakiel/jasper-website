## PROMPT TIPS FOR NANOBANANA PRO

1. **Text Rendering**: NanoBanana Pro excels at text. For the 404 image with "#REF!", specify font style desired.

2. **Search Grounding**: For charts/data visualizations, you can reference "real financial chart style" or "Bloomberg terminal aesthetic"

3. **Consistency**: Generate hero images in same session for style consistency across sectors

4. **Aspect Ratios**: Specify exactly - NanoBanana Pro supports custom ratios

5. **Iteration**: Use "maintain style but change [element]" for variations

6. **Professional Controls**: Specify:
   - Camera angle (low angle, aerial, eye-level)
   - Focus (shallow DOF, deep focus)
   - Color grading (cinematic, corporate, warm, cool)
