# JASPER™ Service Guide
## Complete Investment Packages for DFI Funding Applications

---

## What We Do

JASPER delivers **complete investment packages** for businesses seeking funding from Development Finance Institutions (DFIs). Not just financial models — everything an Investment Committee needs to say yes.

### The Problem We Solve

- You need $1M - $500M+ from DFIs (IFC, AfDB, ADB, EBRD, IDC, DBSA, etc.)
- Big 4 firms charge $50K-$150K and take 3-6 months
- DIY models fail audits, have circular references, broken formulas
- One error = rejected application, months of wasted time

### What Makes Us Different

1. **Complete Packages** — Not just Excel. Business cases, executive summaries, pilot budgets, team profiles. Everything.
2. **Computational Validation** — Python + SciPy mathematically proves every calculation
3. **5-10 Day Delivery** — Complete packages in days, not months
4. **Fixed Pricing** — Know your cost upfront. No scope creep.
5. **Async Process** — No discovery calls. Fill form, get quote, we deliver.

## FAQ

### Do I need to get on a call to discuss my project?
No. We work async. Fill out the intake form with your project details, upload any existing materials, and we'll send you a detailed quote within 24 hours.

### What's the difference between a model and a complete package?
A model is just the Excel file. A complete package includes everything an Investment Committee needs: the model, business case document (30-100 pages), executive summaries, pilot budgets, team profiles, and supporting documentation.

### How do I pay? Do you accept crypto?
Yes. We accept: Crypto (BTC, ETH, USDC, USDT), Wise, Payoneer, and international bank transfer. Payment is 50% upfront, 50% on delivery. All prices in USD.

### What if I need changes after delivery?
Revision rounds are included (2-4 depending on package). Additional rounds are $2,500 each.

### Can you help if I already have a broken model?
Yes. Model rescue is common. We can audit, fix, or rebuild from scratch.
