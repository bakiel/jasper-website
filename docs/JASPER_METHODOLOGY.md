## The JASPER 28™ System

JASPER is a systematic methodology for building investment-grade financial models that survive both technical and financial due diligence.

**The difference:** Most financial modellers understand spreadsheets. We understand how energy systems, infrastructure, and data centres actually operate. We've designed these systems — that's why our models reflect reality.

**What it delivers:**
- Models that pass technical AND financial due diligence
- Zero broken formulas or references
- Complete audit trails
- Multi-DFI formatting from single source

**What we've actually designed and modelled:**
- 1,300 MW renewable complex (solar, wind, biogas, battery storage, smart grid)
- 700 MW data centre with power/cooling economics
- Smart city infrastructure (hydrogen, waste-to-energy, EV networks)
- Multi-DFI agricultural projects (4 institutional packages from single model)

**Why this matters:** When engineers review our models, the assumptions make sense. When bankers review our models, the numbers work. Most models only pass one test. Ours pass both.

## Why Traditional Modelling Fails

### The Problem with Excel-Only Models

1. **Circular References** — Debt ↔ Interest ↔ Cash creates loops that break
2. **Manual Formulas** — Human error in thousands of cells
3. **No Validation** — "It looks right" isn't proof
4. **Black Box** — Can't trace calculations to source
5. **Brittle Structure** — One change breaks everything

### Template Approach
- Adapted from different contexts
- "Close enough" tolerances
- Amateur formatting signals inexperience
- Breaks under DFI scrutiny
- Built by people who don't understand the systems

### JASPER Approach
- Built from first principles by people who've designed these systems
- Zero variance tolerance
- Professional institutional formatting
- Survives investment committee review
- Passes both technical AND financial due diligence

## The 7-Layer Architecture

Every JASPER model follows a systematic layered approach. Each layer builds on the one before it.

## Why This Matters for Funders

### What Investment Committees Look For

1. **Mathematical Integrity** — Do the numbers work?
2. **Audit Trail** — Can we trace every calculation?
3. **Stress Testing** — What happens if assumptions change?
4. **Professional Presentation** — Does this look investable?
5. **Completeness** — Is everything we need here?

### What JASPER Delivers

1. **Validated calculations** — Mathematically proven
2. **Full documentation** — Every assumption traced
3. **Sensitivity analysis** — Multiple scenarios modelled
4. **Investment-grade formatting** — Institutional quality

## The Knowledge Edge

**Why our models pass when others fail:**

Most modellers ask: "What are your assumptions?"
We ask: "Have you considered the heat reuse revenue stream?"

That's the difference between someone who builds spreadsheets and someone who's designed the systems.

**What we bring to every model:**

| System | Knowledge Applied |
|--------|-------------------|
| Solar/Wind | Capacity factors, degradation curves, curtailment risk |
| Battery Storage | Cycling economics, depth of discharge trade-offs |
| Biogas | Feedstock yield curves, digestate revenue |
| Data Centres | PUE modelling, cooling load profiles, redundancy costs |
| Smart Grid | Load balancing, peak shaving economics |
| Heat Reuse | Waste heat valuation, integration economics |
| Agriculture | Hydroponic yields, seasonality, school nutrition integration |
| Food Processing | Capacity utilisation, cold chain, HACCP compliance costs |
| Manufacturing | Working capital cycles, production ramp-up, FMCG distribution |

**This isn't theoretical.** We've designed 1,300 MW integrated systems, 700 MW data centres, hydroponic container farms, and food processing facilities. That experience is embedded in every model we build.
