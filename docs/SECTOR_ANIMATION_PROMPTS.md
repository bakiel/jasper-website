# JASPER Financial Architecture - Sector Animation Prompts

**Generated:** December 2025
**Workflow:** NanoBanana Pro (Static Image) → Kling 1.0 (Image-to-Video Animation)
**Target:** Sector page boxes (aspect-square containers)

> **Note:** Using Kling 1.0 for professional quality output. For image-to-video, the image sets the scene - prompts focus only on **subject + movement**.

---

## WORKFLOW OVERVIEW

### Step 1: NanoBanana Pro - Generate Static Image
Create a high-quality static image optimized for animation.

### Step 2: Kling 1.0 - Animate the Image
Use image-to-video to add subtle, looping motion.

---

## KLING 1.0 PROMPT FORMULA

**Image-to-Video Structure:** `Subject + Movement` (image provides the scene)

### Best Practices (from [Kling AI Prompt Guide](https://ageofllms.com/ai-howto-prompts/ai-fun/kling-ai-promp-guide) & [Segmind Guide](https://blog.segmind.com/best-text-to-video-prompts-for-kling-ai-with-examples/))

**DO:**
- Use action verbs: "rotate," "wave," "blink," "pulse," "flow"
- Keep prompts under 40-50 words
- Be descriptive with sensory/visual detail
- Use "motion blur" for action scenes
- Animate elements sequentially: "A happens, then B happens"
- Set creativity slider to 0.9 for prompt loyalty

**DON'T:**
- Use vague adjectives ("beautiful", "cool", "awesome")
- Rely on specific numbers ("5 trees", "6 boxes")
- Add unmotivated camera movements
- Overload with too many ideas (limit to 2-4 main actions)

### Settings for Kling 1.0
- **Mode:** Professional (for quality)
- **Duration:** 5 seconds
- **Creativity/Relevance:** 0.9 (high prompt adherence)
- **Aspect Ratio:** 1:1 (square for sector boxes)

## GENERAL ANIMATION PRINCIPLES

### For Seamless Loops
1. **Start and end states should match** - design motion that returns to origin
2. **Use subtle, continuous motions** - avoid dramatic start/stop
3. **Keep elements in frame** - no entry/exit animations
4. **Consistent timing** - 5 second loops work best

### Kling-Specific Tips
- Avoid requesting camera movements
- Single focal point animations work best
- Use "subtle", "gentle", "slow" descriptors
- Mention "looping" or "continuous" in prompt
- Lower creativity slider for predictable results

### File Specifications
- **Duration:** 5 seconds
- **Resolution:** 1024x1024 or 720x720
- **Format:** MP4 (H.264)
- **File size target:** <500KB after compression
- **Frame rate:** 24fps

## COMPRESSION WORKFLOW

After generating videos from Kling, compress for web:

```bash
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 \
  -vcodec libx264 \
  -crf 28 \
  -preset slow \
  -vf "scale=512:-2" \
  -an \
  -y \
  output-compressed.mp4
```

---

## IMPLEMENTATION IN CODE

Once videos are generated and compressed, update `SectorDeepDive.tsx`:

```tsx
// Replace SectorVisual component with video
const SectorVisual: React.FC<{ id: string }> = ({ id }) => {
    return (
        <div className="w-full h-full relative">
            <video
                autoPlay
                loop
                muted
                playsInline
                className="w-full h-full object-cover mix-blend-screen"
                style={{
                    maskImage: 'radial-gradient(ellipse 90% 90% at center, black 50%, transparent 100%)',
                    WebkitMaskImage: 'radial-gradient(ellipse 90% 90% at center, black 50%, transparent 100%)'
                }}
            >
                <source src={`/images/sectors/${id}-animation.mp4`} type="video/mp4" />
            </video>
        </div>
    );
};
```
