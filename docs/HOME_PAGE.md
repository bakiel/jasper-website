## Section 1: Hero

**Layout:** Full-width, centered text, dark background (Carbon #0F172A)

### Content

**Eyebrow Text:**
```
DFI INVESTMENT PACKAGES | $5M TO $500M+
```

**H1 Headline:**
```
Financial models built by people who've designed the systems.
```

**Subheadline:**
```
We don't just model energy projects — we've designed 1,300 MW complexes.
That's why our models survive both technical and financial due diligence.

Renewable energy. Infrastructure. Data centres. Agri-industrial.
IFC, AfDB, ADB, EBRD, IDC, DBSA, and climate funds worldwide.

## Section 2: The Problem

**Layout:** Left-aligned text with supporting visual
**Background:** Light (#F8FAFC)

### Content

**Section Label:**
```
THE PROBLEM
```

**H2 Headline:**
```
DFI applications fail at financial review.
Not because projects aren't viable—because models aren't.
```

**Body Copy:**
```
Development finance institutions review hundreds of applications.
Investment committees can spot a template in seconds.

Your project might be solid. But if the financial model doesn't
meet institutional standards, it never reaches the decision-makers.
```

**Problem List:**

```
Common rejection reasons:

✗ Generic templates adapted from different contexts
✗ Unresolved circular references that crash or produce errors
✗ Single-scenario models with no stress testing
✗ Disconnected sheets with hardcoded values
✗ Missing DFI-specific metrics (DSCR, IRR gates, sensitivity)
✗ Models built by people who don't understand how the systems actually work
```

**Closing Statement:**
```
Investment committees allocate capital based on confidence.
Your model is your credibility. Make it count.

Most modellers understand spreadsheets.
We understand how energy systems, infrastructure, and data centres actually operate.
That difference shows in the model.

**Core Components:**

**Component 1: Layered Architecture**
```
7 Integrated Layers
───────────────────
Navigation → Input → Funding → Revenue →
Operations → Financials → Presentation

Each layer connects. Every cell traces back to assumptions.
No orphaned calculations. No hardcoded values.
```

**Component 2: DFI-Specific Formatting**
```
Institution-Ready Output
────────────────────────
Models formatted to meet specific DFI requirements:
• IDC (South Africa) metrics and presentation
• IFC financial covenants and reporting
• AfDB development impact integration
• Land Bank agricultural lending criteria

Same project, multiple institutional packages.
```

**Component 3: Complete Deliverables**
```
Beyond the Spreadsheet
──────────────────────
What we deliver:
• Integrated financial model (28-35 sheets)
• Professional business plan (custom designed)
• Executive investment memorandum

**Project Capability (What We've Built):**
```
Infrastructure Scale:

• 1,300 MW Renewable Complex — Solar (300 MW), wind (300 MW),
  biogas, pyrolysis, 600 MW battery storage. Integrated smart grid
  architecture. Full generation-to-distribution modelling.

• Smart City Energy Infrastructure — Waste-to-energy, hydrogen
  fuel cells, EV charging networks. Urban-scale distributed
  generation with net-zero integration.

• Hyperscale Data Centre (700 MW load) — Power economics,
  liquid cooling systems, heat reuse revenue streams.
  Complex infrastructure financial architecture.

• Multi-DFI Agricultural Projects — Single model producing
  4 institutional packages (IDC, Land Bank, NEF, Ithala).
  Pilot-to-scale funding structures.

What this means for your project:
─────────────────────────────────
✓ Generation, storage, distribution — modelled as integrated systems
✓ Every formula traceable to source assumptions
✓ Formatted for IFC, AfDB, ADB, EBRD, IDC, DBSA, or your target DFI
✓ Built to survive technical and financial due diligence

From 1 MW pilots to 1,300 MW complexes — same methodology, same rigour.

**Systems Knowledge (What We've Actually Designed):**

```
Energy Systems:
─────────────────
• Solar + wind + biogas + pyrolysis integration
• Battery storage sizing and smart grid architecture
• Generation-to-distribution economics
• PPA structures and tariff escalation

Infrastructure Integration:
───────────────────────────
• Waste-to-energy plants
• Hydrogen fuel cells for transport
• EV charging network design
• Heat reuse systems (data centre → greenhouse)

Data Centres:
─────────────
• Power load profiles and redundancy
• Liquid cooling economics
• Uptime guarantees and SLA modelling
• Net-zero facility design

Agricultural & Food Systems:
────────────────────────────
• Biogas feedstock cultivation (Bana grass economics)
• Food-energy-water nexus integration
• Hydroponic container farming systems
• School nutrition programme integration
• Cold chain and post-harvest processing
• Commodity pricing and seasonality modelling
• Pilot-to-scale funding structures

Manufacturing & Processing:
───────────────────────────
• Food processing facility economics
• Production capacity and yield modelling
• Working capital cycles
• FMCG distribution economics
• Quality certification cost integration (HACCP, ISO)
```

**Closing:**
```
This isn't theoretical knowledge. We've designed these systems.
That's why our models reflect how they actually operate—
and why they survive scrutiny from engineers AND bankers.

Business plan mills deliver templates. That's fine for bank loans.

Big 4 consulting delivers prestige. That's worth it for sovereign wealth funds.

We deliver DFI-grade investment packages at mid-market pricing.
More than templates. Less than Big 4 overhead.
The sweet spot for projects that need quality but not a brand name.

## Design Notes

### Infographics to Create

1. **JASPER 28 Architecture Diagram** - Visual showing the 7 layers and how they connect
2. **Scale Comparison** - Visual showing project sizes we've handled
3. **Process Flow** - Clean 5-step horizontal flow
4. **Market Position** - Where JASPER sits vs. alternatives
5. **Layer Integration** - How sheets connect across layers

### Visual Style

- Clean, minimal, professional
- Navy + white primary
- Strategic use of accent colours for CTAs
- Custom infographics over stock photos
- Data visualisations where possible
- No generic business imagery

### Mobile Priority

- Stats stack vertically
- Process steps become vertical timeline
- Cards stack single-column
- CTAs remain prominent

## Key Messaging Summary

| Element | Message |
|---------|---------|
| Headline | "Financial models built by people who've designed the systems" |
| Scale | "1,300 MW designed & modelled, 35-sheet architecture" |
| Core Promise | "Models that pass technical AND financial due diligence" |
| **The Edge** | "We understand how the systems actually work — that's why our models survive scrutiny" |
| Sectors | "Renewable energy, infrastructure, data centres, agri-industrial" |
| Differentiation | "Built by engineers who understand the systems, not spreadsheet jockeys" |
| Geography | "Global — wherever DFIs deploy capital" |
| Qualification | "Projects seeking $5M+ in development finance" |
| Disqualification | "Not for bank loans, visas, or templates" |
| Trust | "50% upfront, 50% on delivery" |
| Payment | "Crypto-native, borderless payments" |
| Process | "Async-first, no calls required" |

## The Knowledge Moat

**Why this matters:** Most financial modellers understand Excel. We understand:
- How 1,300 MW integrated energy systems actually operate
- Battery storage sizing and smart grid economics
- Data centre power/cooling trade-offs
- Heat reuse revenue streams most modellers miss
- Food-energy-water nexus integration

**This isn't a separate service — it's why our models are better.**
